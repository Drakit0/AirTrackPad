Air Trackpad Development Plan (Using MediaPipe with Advanced Techniques)

## Phase 1: Preparation and Setup

### 1.1 Development Environment
1. Ensure Python is set up on both Raspberry Pi and laptop.
2. Install key dependencies:
   - `mediapipe`: For hand detection and landmarks.
   - `opencv-python`: For video capture, image processing, and preprocessing.
   - `numpy`: For matrix operations and numerical data handling.

### 1.2 Initial Tests
1. Verify that the camera (on both Raspberry Pi and laptop) works correctly with OpenCV.
2. Test the MediaPipe hand detection model in real-time.

## Phase 2: Processing Pipeline

### 2.1 Video Capture
**Goal**: Capture frames from the camera in real-time and pass them through a processing pipeline without delays.

**Steps**:
1. Set up video capture using OpenCV to retrieve frames from the camera.
2. Adjust the resolution based on the device (lower resolution for Raspberry Pi).
3. Normalize colors if the background is inconsistent (e.g., use HSV conversion for stabilization).

### 2.2 Image Preprocessing
**Goal**: Increase system accuracy by eliminating noise and highlighting key features.

**Techniques**:
1. **Edge Detection (Sobel/Canny)**:
   - Apply edge filters to the regions of interest to validate MediaPipe detections.
2. **Background Subtraction**:
   - Use techniques like MOG2 (from OpenCV) to remove irrelevant background information.
3. **Contrast Standardization**:
   - Enhance contrast with histogram equalization techniques.

### 2.3 Hand Detection with MediaPipe
**Goal**: Detect hands and extract key landmarks.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize the MediaPipe Model:
   - Configure the detector with optimal parameters for real-time performance.
2. Process Each Frame:
   - Pass preprocessed frames into the MediaPipe detector.
3. Extract Landmarks:
   - Retrieve the 3D coordinates of key points such as the index fingertip and palm center.

## Phase 3: Enrichment with Learned Techniques

### 3.1 Refinement with Image Processing
1. **Corner Detection**:
   - Use Harris or Shi-Tomasi methods to analyze whether MediaPipe landmarks align with areas of high local variation.
   - Helps validate detections in complex or moving backgrounds.
2. **Feature Matching**:
   - Apply SIFT/KAZE in critical areas (e.g., fingers) to track textures or keypoints that complement MediaPipe landmarks.
   - Useful when MediaPipe temporarily loses precision.

### 3.2 Tracking and Stabilization
1. **Optical Flow**:
   - Use optical flow (e.g., Lucas-Kanade) to track motion between frames.
   - Integrate this tracking with MediaPipe landmarks for smoother movements.
2. **Kalman Filter**:
   - Design a filter to predict cursor position based on past movements.
   - Helps mitigate abrupt jumps caused by detection failures.

### 3.3 Complex Gesture Recognition
1. **Bag of Visual Words**:
   - Train a model based on the bag of visual words approach to recognize specific gestures (e.g., "click," "drag," "scroll").
   - Use features detected with SIFT/KAZE as inputs for the classifier.
2. **Gesture Classification**:
   - Design rules or use an ML classifier (e.g., SVM or Random Forest) to map landmark configurations to actions.

## Phase 4: Cursor Mapping and Control

### 4.1 Coordinate Mapping
1. Scale landmark positions to the screen size.
2. Dynamically adjust based on input and output resolutions.

### 4.2 Action Definitions
1. Define cursor actions:
   - **Movement**: Based on index finger position.
   - **Click**: Based on a gesture (e.g., pinch with thumb and index finger).
   - **Scroll**: Based on vertical or circular gestures.

## Phase 5: Optimization

### 5.1 Adaptation to Different Backgrounds
1. Implement color or texture detection to automatically adjust preprocessing based on the background.

### 5.2 Performance on Raspberry Pi
1. Lower resolution and processing frequency if necessary.
2. Consider processing only a region of interest (ROI) around the hand.

### 5.3 Stability Tests
1. Test with different backgrounds, movement speeds, and lighting conditions.

---

## Phase 6: User Interface and Debugging

### 6.1 Visual Interface
1. Display detected landmarks and cursor movement in real-time for debugging.

### 6.2 Event Logging
1. Create a logging system to record detection failures or performance issues.

### 6.3 Final Testing
1. Validate the system on multiple devices and under different conditions.
